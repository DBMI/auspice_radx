## Differences In JSON Files

There are tow main differences between the original entropy-style JSON files and the new signature-style files:

1) The signature JSON files need to list signature as a panel as shown below (ncov_signatures.json).
2) The corresponding root sequence file needs to be present (ncov_signatures_root-sequence.json).
